Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get
 the maximum total value in the knapsack.

In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or don’t take it.

Input:
  Items as (value, weight) pairs
  arr[] = {{60, 10}, {100, 20}, {120, 30}}
  Knapsack Capacity, W = 50;
Output:
  Maximum possible value = 240
  by taking items of weight 10 and 20 kg and 2/3 fraction of 30 kg. Hence total price will be 60+100+(2/3)(120) = 240
