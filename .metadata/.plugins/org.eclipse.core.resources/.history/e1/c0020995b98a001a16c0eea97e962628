Find an element in Bitonic array
Given a bitonic sequence of n distinct elements, write a program to find a given element x in the bitonic sequence in O(log n) time. A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing.

Examples:

Input :  arr[] = {-3, 9, 8, 20, 17, 5, 1};
         key = 20
Output : Found at index 3

Input :  arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3};
         key = 30
Output : Not Found
