boolean add(E e) - Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so
     * immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning
     * {@code true} upon success and throwing an {@code IllegalStateException}
     * if no space is currently available.

boolean offer(E e) - Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do
     * so immediately without violating capacity restrictions.
     * When using a capacity-restricted queue, this method is generally
     * preferable to {@link #add}, which can fail to insert an element only
     * by throwing an exception.
  
E remove() - Retrieves and removes the head of this queue.  This method differs
     * from {@link #poll poll} only in that it throws an exception if this
     * queue is empty.
    
E poll() - Retrieves and removes the head of this queue,
     * or returns {@code null} if this queue is empty.
 
E element() - Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue.  This method
     * differs from {@link #peek peek} only in that it throws an exception
     * if this queue is empty.

E peek() - Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue,
     * or returns {@code null} if this queue is empty.
